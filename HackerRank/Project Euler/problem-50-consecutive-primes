# How the heck am I supposed to test these values without an array leading up to N?
# I guess I don't need all the primes, just the primes that add up to N...

# Gonna have to try a different way...
# Need to mod my original js answer to accept an array of inputs, save the results and use them for the next one.
# Damn, I didn't think about needing to NOT sort them... maybe that's it.

# Modded it to start with the largest 2 chain and work from there
# Now I'm getting a wrong answer somewhere?
# Wow, everything but testcase 3 :/

# Found the error, woo!
