Andy's repository of freeCodeCamp exercises to remember

I like Project Euler problems, they're pretty fun to keep track of, especially as they start encouraging more complex algorithms relating to encryption or whatnot.

For other tutorials and certifications, I keep the lesson code if I think I'm going to have trouble or need to remember the basics in the future.
