Problem 73: Counting fractions in a range
Consider the fraction,  nd
 , where n and d are positive integers. If n < d and highest common factor,  HCF(n,d)=1
 , it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ 8 in ascending order of size, we get:

18,17,16,15,14,27,13,38,25,37,12,47,35,58,23,57,34,45,56,67,78
 
It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between  13
  and  12
 .

How many fractions lie between  13
  and  12
  in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for d ≤ limit?
--
Many variations on a theme...
let's see if this is countable for now.
--
Nevermind, this is getting complicated.
Gotta use some trick of co-primes. 
If the last exercise taught me that the irreducible fractions beneath a limit has to do with coprimes, then it must be the same with between two points.
