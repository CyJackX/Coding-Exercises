/*
Problem 85: Counting rectangles
By counting carefully it can be seen that a rectangular grid measuring 3 by 2 contains eighteen rectangles:

a diagram of the different rectangles found within a 3 by 2 rectangular grid
Although there may not exists a rectangular grid that contains exactly n rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.
--
Okay, at first I didn't see the dynamic element, but now I see it.  Every smaller rectangle is comprised of previous problems.  But how to extend it two dimensionally?
Maybe if I conceptualize it along one axis I can extend it.
--
Didn't need to dynamically program at all, I guess it's easy enough to just do em all.  The arrangement was a little tricky but not too bad.
